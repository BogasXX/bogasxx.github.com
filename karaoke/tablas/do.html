<br>Have you got colour in your cheeks? </br>
<br>Do you ever get that fear that you can’t shift the tide that sticks around like summat’s in your teeth? </br>
<br>Hide some aces up your sleeve </br>
<br>Have you no idea that you’re in deep? </br>
<br>I dreamt about you nearly every night this week </br>
<br>How many secrets can you keep? </br>
<br>Cause there’s this tune I’ve found that makes me think of you somehow </br>
<br>And I play it on repeat until I fall asleep </br>
<br>Spilling drinks on my settee </br>

<br>(Do I wanna know?) </br>
<br>If this feeling flows both ways </br>
<br>(It’s hard to see you go) </br>
<br>I’m sorta hoping that you’d stay </br>
<br>(Baby we both know) </br>
<br>That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day </br>

<br>Crawling back to you </br>
<br>Ever thought of calling when you’ve had a few? </br>
<br>Cause I always do </br>
<br>Well baby I’m too busy being yours to fall for somebody new </br>
<br>Now I’ve thought it through </br>
<br>Crawling back to you </br>

<br>So have you got the guts? </br>
<br>Been wondering if your heart’s still open, and if so I wanna know what time it shuts </br>
<br>Simmer down and pucker up </br>
<br>I’m sorry to interrupt </br>
<br>It’s just I’m constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you </br>
<br>But I dunno if you feel the same as I do </br>
<br>We could be together if you wanted to </br>

<br>(Do I wanna know?) </br>
<br>If this feeling flows both ways</br> 
<br>(It’s hard to see you go) </br>
<br>I’m sorta hoping that you’d stay </br>
<br>(Baby we both know) </br>
<br>That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day </br>

<br>Crawling back to you 
<br>Ever thought of calling when </br>
<br>(You’ve had a few) </br>
<br>Darling when you’ve had a few </br>
<br>(Cause I always do) </br>
<br>Cause I always do </br>
<br>(Well baby I’m too) </br>
<br>Way too busy being yours to fall for somebody new </br>
<br>Now I’ve thought it through </br>
<br>Crawling back to you </br>

<br>(Do I wanna know?) </br>
<br>If this feeling flows both ways </br>
<br>(It’s hard to see you go) </br>
<br>I’m sorta hoping that you’d stay </br>
<br>(Baby we both know) </br>
<br>That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day</br> 

<br>(Do I wanna know?) </br>
<br>Too busy being yours to fall</br> 
<br>(Hard to see you go) </br>
<br>Ever thought of calling darling?</br> 
<br>(Do I wanna know?) </br>
<br>Do you want me crawling back to you?</br>
