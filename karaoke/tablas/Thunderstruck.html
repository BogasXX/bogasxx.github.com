<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>I was caught 
<br>
 <br>In the middle of a railroad track
 <br> 
 <br>thunder
 <br>

<br>I looked round 
<br>
<br>And I knew there was no turning back
<br>
 
<br>My mind raced
<br>
 
<br>And I thought what could I do <br>


<br>And I knew
<br>
 
<br>There was no help, no help from you 
<br>
<br>Sound of the drums 
<br>

<br>Beating in my heart 
<br>

<br>The thunder of guns 
<br>

<br>Tore me apart 
<br>

<br>You've been 
<br>
<br>
<br>Thunderstruck 

<br>Rode down the highway 
<br>
<br>
<br>Broke the limit, we hit the town 
<br>
<br>
<br>Went through to Texas, yeah Texas, and we had some fun 
<br>

<br>We met some girls 
<br>
<br>Some dancers who gave a good time 
<br>
<br>Broke all the rules 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Played all the fools 
<br>
<br>Yeah yeah they, they, they blew our minds 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>And I was shaking at the knees 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Could I come again please 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Yeah them ladies were too kind 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>You've been 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Thunderstruck
